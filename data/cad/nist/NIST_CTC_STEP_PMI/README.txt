The STEP AP203 and AP242 files were generated from the CTC and FTC CAD models used in the 
NIST MBE PMI Validation and Conformance Testing project.

The STEP files were generated by different CAD software and might not represent the current
capabilities of that software.  Information that might show which CAD software generated the
files has been removed.

The '_ap203' and '_ap242' files have graphical PMI.  The '_ap242' files have semantic PMI.
The other STEP files contain only part geometry.  

AP242 files are identified by '_ap242-e1' or '_ap242-e2' for the edition 1 or 2 of AP242.
Edition 1 was published in 2014 and edition 2 was published in 2020.

FTC 8 also has a file '_ap242-e1-tg' where the part geometry uses tessellated (faceted)
surfaces instead of exact geometry.  There is no semantic PMI in this file.

Your CAD software or STEP viewer might not support graphical and semantic PMI.  Use the
STEP File Analyzer and Viewer to view the graphical PMI and to analyze the semantic PMI.

The semantic PMI analysis for the AP242 files will be color-coded by the expected PMI.

These are NOT reference STEP files without any errors.  The STEP File Analyzer and Viewer
will report some Syntax Errors.  Other conformance checking software might also indicate
that the files have some errors.

To test how well your CAD system implements STEP AP242 PMI, download the NIST PMI CAD models,
open one of the models, export an AP242 file with PMI and process it with the STEP File
Analyzer and Viewer.  The spreadsheet results will indicate how well the AP242 semantic PMI
matches the expected PMI in the test case definition.  Differences might due to how some PMI
was modeled in the CAD system or how the PMI was exported to the STEP file.
