<h1 id="toc-cad-model-validity">CAD model validity</h1>

<blockquote class="quote">"All models are wrong, but some are useful." George Box</blockquote>

<div class="toc-panel"><div id="toc"></div></div>

<p>
This text is a digest of shape defects often occurring in various CAD applications. The problems come from different sources. CAD packages are based on different geometric modeling kernels (e.g., Parasolid for SolidWorks, CGM for Catia, ACIS for SpaceClaim), so they basically "speak different geometric languages," hence there are inevitable "translation errors." The geometric flaws are often due to the approximation errors and imprecision of low-level numerical algorithms. Sometimes, it’s lossy data exchange to blame or even an improper design software used to build the geometry.
</p>

<p>
As shape healing remains largely a challenge for CAD practitioners, one must be aware of possible anomalies and their implications on subsequent engineering workflows. Being attentive to a CAD shape's validity, you will avoid many die-hard obstacles down the road. Most of the listed flaws are tough to resolve, although for simple cases it is possible to automate healing pre-processing (e.g., fixing missing seam edges).
</p>

<h1 id="toc-levels-of-validity">Different levels of validity</h1>

<p>
A comprehensive analysis of CAD model validity should employ thinking at several levels of abstraction: math, data structures, and design intent.
</p>

<p>
The following rule usually works in shape healing: fixing a lower-level problem requires thinking at the upper level of abstraction. E.g., to wisely fill a gap due to a missing face (a pure geometric flaw), it might be necessary to recognize and recover its entire containing feature. One way of doing so is extending and intersecting surfaces rather than patching a hole with a NURBS surface. Thinking of features brings us to the design intent that’s not a geometric issue anymore.
</p>

<p>
Checking for the CAD model’s validity should always be based on its application domain. E.g., self-intersection defects might be critical for mesh generation algorithms. At the same time, they often have zero impact on specific shape interrogation and modeling workflows, such as the unfolding of sheet metals. Therefore, a “silver bullet” solution does not exist in shape healing. Keep in mind that “all models are wrong, but some are useful.”
</p>

<p>
The remainder of this article provides a checklist for a CAD model to verify its validity. These checks are relevant to a B-Rep representation scheme of OpenCascade kernel only, though some of them can be generalized. The set of checks listed below is not complete, as there are too many. At the same time, the most frequently occurring defects are enumerated.
</p>

<h2 id="toc-consistency-of-representation">Consistency of representation</h2>

<p>
<i>Geometric validity</i> (parameterization irregularities, curve/surface self-intersections, parametric discontinuities, etc.). The geometric validity checks are concerned with the mathematics of form. The input data here are the equations of curves and surfaces, while the verification methods usually employ some computationally expensive algorithms (intersection tests, sampling, evaluation of derivatives, etc.).
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> an aerodynamic surface having C<sup>0</sup> continuity (smoothness defect) in its interior.
</p>

<p>
<i>Topological validity</i> (orientations of boundary elements, face/solid closeness, formal shape structure, etc.). The topological validity checkers perform syntactic analysis, i.e. they check that the data structures respect some formal rules of consistency.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example:</b> a face with 3 contours nested into each other.
</p>

<p>
The distinguishing between pure geometric and topological invalidities makes little sense to the end-users. Such division facilitates software maintainability and reflects the separation between “geometry” and “topology” in B-Rep data structures. In practice, maintaining representation integrity is a direct function of a geometric modeling system, whatever abstraction it uses under the cover.

      All surface intersections should be resolved by inserting the corresponding topological primitives (vertices, edges or patches in case of overlapping). If surfaces interact while having no topological resolution, the shape is considered locally faulty. Intersections or overlaps of the trimmed NURBS surfaces are a huge challenge for healing algorithms <a href="../references.html#frischmann-2011">[Frischmann, 2011]</a>. One way to solve this issue is to manually remove and repatch faces.

    <p>
      A correct shape with all its subshapes must bound a piece of volume in the modeling space unambiguously. However, sometimes this basic requirement is not satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's take a solid with some inner shells as an example. A shell entity contained in a solid can represent either the outer boundary or an inner cavity of a body. A point in the cavity shell should be formally inside its parent solid (simply because any cavity is entirely enclosed by its bounding solid). Otherwise, there is an inclusion error (see the figure below). 
    </p>
    <p><div align="center"><img src="../imgs/anomaly_inv_shells_expl.png"/></div></p>
    <p>
      In some rare cases, such invalid space partitioning may occur as a result of the faulty Boolean operation. Imagine that a Tool body is being subtracted from an Object body to produce a Result shape (its expected form is illustrated above on the right). Now imagine that the modeling kernel fails (for whatever reason) to classify the Tool correctly. In the figure above, the Tool solid was incorrectly classified as lying INSIDE the Object. Hence the orientation of the Tool was reversed while the boundary edges were taken as is. If you sample any point on the cavity shell, you would generally expect that this point is INSIDE the parent solid. However, in the example above, some points of the Tool body are classified as OUTSIDE w.r.t. the Result shape.
    </p>

       <div align="center" class="code-inline">cad/anomalies/freecad/index_hmd_frunk.stp</div></p>
    <p>
      This problem can hardly be fixed automatically as the ambiguous space partitioning leaves the design intent unclear. The users observing this sort of error should instead return to the corresponding design tools to try fixing the source of the issue (e.g., tweak the operands of the Boolean cut as in the example above).

<p>
  A formally sound CAD model can happen to contain redundant information, such as overcomplicated geometry definition or excessive boundary elements. While such models do not violate any validity rules, they challenge the modeling algorithms and require extra computational resources.
</p>

<p><b>Example:</b> a spline surface where canonical geometry is a better fit, like a cone or cylinder.</p>

<p>The following two sources of "shape dirtiness" tend to be common:
<ul>
  <li>Excessive shape description.</li>
  <li>High geometric tolerances.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  The excessive shape description might lead to an aggressive increase in memory consumption or badly influence geometry processing algorithms. Moreover, excessive shape representation might cause numeric instability within the downstream engineering workflows <a href="../references.html#frischmann-2011">[Frischmann, 2011]</a>. At the same time, such flaws do not break the formal validity of a CAD model.

      Maintaining high-fidelity B-Rep is a challenge. Geometric modeling kernels, such as OpenCascade or Parasolid, implement the "tolerant modeling" approach. I.e., instead of using a global geometric inaccuracy, each boundary element (vertex, edge and face) has its own associated imprecision value called [geometric] tolerance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visually fine B-Rep model may contain significant geometric flaws like small gaps between faces or wild parameterization of curves. Since what you see on a display is not the real shape but only its faceted approximation, such imperfections remain hidden unless your modeling engine suddenly stops working on downstream operations.

      The support of C<sup>0</sup> geometric primitives is limited in all geometric kernels. It is
      usually a good idea to split such entities with the relevant boundary elements (vertices or edges)
      to enhance the smoothness of the geometry. Alternatively, for NURBS curves
      and surfaces, it is possible to remove knots if the shape is geometrically continuous
      though parameterized improperly. The knot insertion algorithm can also be applied
      for non-G-smooth geometric elements if a certain deformation (within the prescribed
      tolerance) is allowed.

      In OpenCascade kernel, each topological element might be assigned with a local transformation to place it relative to its parent element. While this capacity of the modeler is convenient for representing assemblies as compounds, we discourage using the transformed boundary elements in a single solid representation. Formally speaking, a local transformation is a property of an arc in the topology graph. It is OK to have a local transformation for in-compound inclusions and not OK to have them deeper in the graph.

    <p>
      For some operations like removing face, push/pull, etc. surface extensions are used. It may easily happen that if parameter lines of a surface are converging, the surface extension starts to self-intersect. In such situations, any modeling operators which require surface extensions will likely fail. Another problem is a highly oscillating surface when sampled out of its trimming contour.

  The function of the part and its manufacturing constraints are encoded in what’s called a “design intent.” The improperly designed models can have no geometric flaws yet remain incorrect from the engineering standpoint.
</p>

<p><b>Example:</b> a sheet metal part of uneven thickness.</p>

<p>
  It is not a geometric kernel to blame in such situations. At the same time, a geometric kernel might still be helpful in discovering the violated functional and technological requirements.

      A beautified geometric model is a modification of the input model that incorporates appropriate symmetries and constraints like parallelism, orthogonality, etc. <a href="../references.html#gonzales-2017">[González-Lluch et al, 2017]</a>. Beautification-pending models can emerge as a result of reverse engineering of a B-Rep model from a discrete dataset (point clouds, mesh).

      The following picture illustrates a problem of inconsistent tolerance definition (taken from <a href="http://blog.flightstory.net/137/787-problems-joining-fuselage-sections-fuselage-gaps/">Flightstory.net</a> aviation blog):
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img src="../imgs/anomaly_tolerance-stack-up.png"/></div>
    <p>
      This is a typical stack-up problem: the parts do not assemble properly in their maximum tolerance condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problems like this gave raise to Computer-Aided Tolerancing field, which is concerned with providing a consistent set of technological/assembly tolerances. It is necessary to ensure that the part can function in maximum, minimum, and varied conditions.
